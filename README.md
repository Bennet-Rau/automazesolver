# automazesolver
An automatic maze solver in C++

This program uses a depth first traversal to solve any maze automatically. It will solve this through a Depth First Search mehtod. This program uses a stack to keep track of the right path. DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. In the context of maze solving, it explores possible paths as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking. This approach mimics the behavior of exploring a maze by following one path until reaching a dead end, then retracing your steps and trying another path until a solution is found.

Things to note for the program:
W represent walls of the maze
O represents open spaces for possibles moves
S represents the start of the maze
E represents the end of the maze
